                    Hello there! My name is Pasin Sirirat, I am currently studying in the Industrial Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering at Chulalongkorn University.<br>
                    I am interesting in the field of Data Science, how statistics, computer programming and the knowledge in a specific area are combined and become a new field of discovering insights.<br>
                    Besides, I am a musician, I have been playing music since I was four years old. Keep playing and practicing more instruments de-stress me a lot. Hence, I believe that music can cure sadness.<br>
                    I also love to learn languages, both human-wise and machine-wise. For the former, I am studying French, Russian, and Chinese. For the latter, I have skills in Python, R, SQL, HTML (+CSS) and are learning JavaScript in several frameworks.

                </p>

                    While I was working there, I participated in the Telecommunication export value forecasting project. Telecommunication products play a huge role in stabilizing Thailand's economy, with it's value ranked between the top 10 sectors with highest export in the country.
                    My task was to predict the export value of this sector using two forecasting methods, Time-Series forecasting and Machine Learning algorithms using the import value of relevant parts used to produce the items in the sector. Then all results were compared.

                <p>The Fundamental Engineering Camp (FECamp) is a project by a group of engineering students aiming to teach high-school students who want to
                    apply to the engineering path in the bachelor's level. I was working in the academic squad, being a head of the team. My job is to train the new generation of teachers
                    (university students, should I say?) about techniques, knowledges, and core values of the camp. I also planned the working schedule, set the objective, and taught high-school students.
