                    Hello! My name is Pasin Sirirat. I am a Data Scientist working at a consulting firm called Sentrics Consulting.<br>I am currently working with a client which is an insurance company. My tasks are to find potential leads to buy insurance products, to evaluate customers' satisfaction, and to analyze claim behaviour of customers.<br>
                    Besides, I am a musician, I have been playing music since I was four years old. Keep playing and practicing more instruments de-stress me a lot. Hence, I believe that music can cure sadness.<br>
                    I also love to learn languages, both human-wise and machine-wise. For the former, I am studying French, Russian, and Chinese. For the latter, I have skills in Python, R, SQL, HTML (+CSS) and are learning JavaScript in several frameworks.

                    My task was to predict the export value of this sector using two forecasting methods, Time-Series forecasting and Machine Learning algorithms using the import value of relevant parts used to produce the items in the sector. Then all results were compared.
